                                    <h2>I am Atmashree Ray and this is my story.</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Let me share a little bit about myself. I was born in the late 1990s in Silchar, Assam, India.
                                        Computers have been a part of my world since I was a toddler. I remember accompanying my mother
                                        during her PhD days to various printing presses where they would generously let me use one of their
                                        machines to play games. I remember being fascinated by these machines for the longest time. One of 
                                        the burning questions in my mind during my school days was how computers work. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Although that question was never fully answered in school, I did get to learn various cool things
                                        to do on a computer. I remember learning about websites and html in class 6 and obviously, I had
                                        to build my own website. My first website was about a TV show. Although it had the look and feel
                                        of an actual late-2000s website, it was never on the internet simply because I did not know how to put it on 
                                        the internet.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I spent days building my first website and then weeks researching how to put it on the internet.
                                        However, 11 year old me could not find an answer. So, like any other pre-teen, I moved on to other
                                        novel and interesting ventures. Months and years passed by, life started to get serious, big decisions
                                        were made regarding my career path and eventually seven years after the creation of my first website
                                        I found myself at a web-dev class. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As it turned out, I was a Computer Science and Engineering freshman in National Institute of Technology, Silchar
                                        and the web-dev class was an offering of the Computer Science Society at NIT, Silchar. That class helped me 
                                        refresh my knowledge of web-dev. As time progressed, I found all my questions regarding computers get answered.
                                        I came to know how computers work, how websites work, how two or more computers can be connected,
                                        what is AI, etc at an atomic level. Needless to say, I found my peace in NIT, Silchar.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I graduated from NIT, Silchar in 2020. The four years that I have spent at NIT, Silchar have been the mostly plesant,
                                        rewarding and fulfilling years of my life. The invaluable experiences that I have gathered will forever help me navigate
                                        the course of life. I am eternally grateful to everyone who made this journey possible.

                                    <h2>So, what about extra curriculars?</h2>
                                        <p>
                                            I am glad you asked. People who know me know how much I am interested in music. I have been trained in vocal music for about 13
                                            years. Rabindra Sangeet is my forte. I have also been trained in Hindustani Classical Music. Apart from that, I take interest in 
                                            Western Classical Music. Often I find myself comparing the different froms of music to discover similarities and differences.
                                            I recently picked up the guitar and the ukulele.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Apart from music, I like to read novels and travel far and wide. I have participated in recitation competitions, debates, extermpore
                                            speech competition, various Science and Math Olympiads throughout my school days.
